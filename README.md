# TranslationRO-BR
 A client-side translation for Ragnarok to Brazilian Portuguese


This translation was made using assets from bRO client and with the help of some files scattered in rAthena forums.

I packed the translation into 2 files: 

1) a grf containing the data folder: portuguese.grf
2) and the System folder with the correct lub/lua files

-You can add portuguese.grf to your data.ini or export it as a data folder to your client.
-Don't forget to Diff your Ragexe with a tool such as Nemo and correct the lub files path with the .lub file name 
on System folder

Obs: to translate the npcs to portuguese you need to change the files server-side on the folder yourEmulator/npc.
I'm working on that and will be happy to provide it when i'm done =)

Any questions i'm on rAthena discord support chat.
