# TranslationRO-BR
 A client-side translation for Ragnarok to Brazilian Portuguese


This translation was made using assets from bRO client and with the help of some files scattered in rAthena forums.

I packed the translation into 2 files: 

1) The data folder containing portuguese assets
2) and the System folder with the correct lub/lua files for portuguese,

-You can make a ".grf" file with the data folder and use it on your client.
-Don't forget to Diff your Ragexe with a tool such as Nemo and correct the lub files path with the .lub file name 
on System folder

Obs: to translate the npcs to portuguese you need to change the files server-side, on the folder yourEmulator/npc.
I'm working on that and will be happy to provide it when i'm done =)

Any questions i'm on rAthena discord support chat.
